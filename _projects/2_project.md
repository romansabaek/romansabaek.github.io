<p><b>1. Project Description:</b> RoboCup Rescue Robot Challenge aims to create autonomous and semi-autonomous robots capable of assisting in disaster response and rescue missions. The challenge emphasizes real-world scenarios where robots can help locate and rescue victims, assess damage, and navigate hazardous environments. </p>

<p><b>2. Project Period:</b> 2016.01 ~ 2016.07 </p>
<p><b>3. Team Members:</b> <b>Donghoon Baek</b>, Yitaek Kim, Hansoul Kim, SuYeon Lee, Hyeongon Kim, Hyeonseok Lee, Taemin Hwang </p>
<p><b>4. My Role: I was primarily responsible for 1) designing and controlling the 6-DOF manipulator, 2) controlling the four legs equipped with caterpillar tracks, and 3) developing the GUI for motor control. </b></p>


<b>5. Teleoperated Rescue Robot ROFA:</b> We developed ROSA, an advanced version of the teleoperated rescue robot ROFA (see another project). ROSA features two main caterpillar tracks on its body and four additional tracks on its legs for enhanced mobility. It includes a 6-DOF manipulator, tactile sensors, a microphone, and an onboard laptop PC that can be accessed via Wi-Fi for teleoperation. A custom, user-friendly graphical interface was developed to facilitate remote control of the robot.
