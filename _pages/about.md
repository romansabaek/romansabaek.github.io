I'm a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Science and Engineering at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://mechse.illinois.edu/), co-advised by [Prof. Joao Ramos](https://publish.illinois.edu/jlramos/) and [Prof. Saurabh Gupta](http://saurabhg.web.illinois.edu/). I received my Master of Science degree in the Robotics Program from [the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), fortunately advised by [Prof. Dong-soo Kwon](http://robot.kaist.ac.kr/professor/?ckattempt=1). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Program from the [University of Kwangwoon](https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/) in the Republic of Korea. I also worked as a research engineer at [ROEN Sugrical Inc](https://www.roensurgical.com/), a medical robot startup.

My reserach interests lie in **Robotics, Machine Learning, Control, Embodied Intelligence (sim-to-real transfer)**. My research goal is to build an intelligent robotic system capable of adapting and interacting with its surrounding environment. As a great application of this, I am interested in legged robot and medical robot.
