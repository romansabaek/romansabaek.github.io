Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Science and Engineering at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://mechse.illinois.edu/), co-advised by [Prof. Joao Ramos](https://publish.illinois.edu/jlramos/) and [Prof. Saurabh Gupta](http://saurabhg.web.illinois.edu/). I received my Master of Science degree in the Robotics Program from [the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), fortunately advised by [Prof. Dong-soo Kwon](http://robot.kaist.ac.kr/professor/?ckattempt=1). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Program from the [University of Kwangwoon](https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/univ/electronic08_1.jsp#:~:text=Kwangwoon%20University's%20Division%20of%20Robotics%20is%20also%20the%20home%20of,applied%20to%20various%20industrial%20fields.) in the Republic of Korea, advised by [Prof. Juhoon Back](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b6GLVA8AAAAJ&hl=en). I also worked as a research engineer at [ROEN Sugrical Inc](https://www.roensurgical.com/), a medical robot startup.

My reserach interests lie in **Robotics, Machine Learning, Control, Embodied Intelligence (sim-to-real transfer)**. My research goal is to build an intelligent robotic system capable of adapting and interacting with its surrounding environment. As a great application of this, I am interested in **legged robot** and **medical robot**.
