I'm a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, co-advised by Prof. Joao Ramos and Prof. Saurabh Gupta. I received my Master of Science degree in the Robotics Program from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), fortunately advised by Prof. Dong-soo Kwon. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Program from the University of Kwangwoon in the Republic of Korea. I also worked as a research engineer at ROEN Sugrical Inc, a medical robot startup.

My reserach interests lie in **Robotics, Machine Learning, Control, Embodied Intelligence (sim-to-real transfer)**. My research goal is to build an intelligent robotic system capable of adapting and interacting with its surrounding environment. As a great application of this, I am interested in legged robot and medical robot.
